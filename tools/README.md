# tools

Development tools; nothing here ships with the game. Each `tools/r<NN>_<lane>/`
folder belongs to the round lane (or older work package) that wrote it; the
shared entry points are below and the per-round folders at the end
("Lane folders"). Which checks a lane or a round end must run:
[round workflow](../docs/process/round-workflow.md#3-gates).

## Fixtures

`tools/run_fixtures.sh` runs every portable fixture (`tools/*/portable_test.lua`
and `tools/*/fixture.lua`) under LuaJIT with the repository path as its
argument, four at a time under idle scheduling, and prints one line per fixture
and a summary; it exits 1 when any fixture fails and shows the end of that
fixture's output.

```sh
tools/run_fixtures.sh                 # every fixture (about 2-3 minutes)
tools/run_fixtures.sh r30_p1 r31_c    # only these folders
JOBS=6 tools/run_fixtures.sh          # more processes at once
```

Two kinds run differently: a `fixture.lua` that returns a function runs through
the `micro.lua` beside it (`r23_full_column`, `r24_fill`), and `r30_p3` runs
through its `run.sh` (seeds 12345 and 42, two processes, a scratch world each).
A new fixture follows the same contract: it takes the repository path as
`arg[1]` and exits non-zero on failure.

## Seed fleet

`tools/seed_fleet/run.sh` builds the portable world (`r28_zone_atlas/world.lua`,
the load path up to the R7 anchor roster) for the fixed seeds of
`tools/seed_fleet/seeds.txt`, eight at a time under idle scheduling and without
a wall-clock limit, prints each failed seed with its error and a summary, and
exits 1 on any failure (the [round workflow](../docs/process/round-workflow.md#3-gates)
says when each size is required).

```sh
tools/seed_fleet/run.sh quick         # the first 100 seeds (about 4 minutes)
tools/seed_fleet/run.sh full          # every seed, about 300 (about 13 minutes)
tools/seed_fleet/run.sh quick 20      # plus 20 random seeds (printed)
```

## Other checks

- `tools/check_lua.sh <files>`: plain Lua 5.1 parser, `SETGLOBAL` list and the
  sweeps of [docs/technical/luanti-lua.md](../docs/technical/luanti-lua.md)
  (needs ripgrep).
- `python3 tools/check_fresh_server.py`: the fresh-server source audit.
- `tools/luanti_headless.sh`: an isolated headless engine boot (never the
  personal Luanti folder; options in the script header).
- `tools/r35_t/upstream_check.sh`: whether the installed engine still
  misreads rotated selection boxes (prints `FIXED` or `BUG PRESENT`); run it
  at every engine version change with the rest of
  `docs/technical/upstream-workarounds.md`.
- `python3 tools/r36_p/render.py OUT_DIR`: renders every POI as the runtime
  builds it (isometric view, top-down plan, two other race palettes;
  `page.py` makes the review page); `tools/r36_w/render.py` and `page.py`
  the before/after pages of a decor change.

## Lane folders

Fixtures and probes by round (moved from AGENTS.md on 2026-10-05). A
`portable_test.lua` runs under `run_fixtures.sh`; an `engine.sh` is a
headless probe with a throwaway probe mod (`grug_probe_*`, never shipped).
Older folders (`r10_*` … `r28_*`, `wp13`, `wp26`, `wp40`) follow the same
pattern; the shared Round 28 tools (`r28_design`, `r28_regions`,
`r28_world`, `r28_names`, `r28_zone_atlas`) are named in AGENTS.md.

- **Round 29** (`r29_<lane>`): `b` boats, `w` waystones, `e1` prices and
  `band_payout.sh`, `e4` income (`income.py`), `mres` gems, `mgeo` bands and
  middle road, `q1` placeholders, `t` the tests of
  `r28_regions/quest_targets.py`, `p` playtest fixes.
- **Round 30** (`r30_<lane>`): `p1` quest state, tracker, Map tab, minimap and
  Character page; `p2` pathing, give-up, collision boxes, merged spawn ABMs;
  `p3` region-map cache incl. input coverage and corruption cases, `run.sh`;
  `p4` crafting index with the shipped recipe corpus, crosshair, carriers,
  flight sweep, farming; `l` island landings, `engine.sh`; `c` start-NPC
  duplication.
- **Round 31** (`r31_<lane>`): `pvp` flag core and engine probe, `p2` PvP UI,
  `p1b` support refusal and mount boxes, `n` faction filter, `c` clean-up,
  `a` looks and `engine.sh`, `b` enchant colours, masks and `engine.sh`, `s`
  PvP blueprints, `m` placement, `spacing_check.lua` and `engine.sh`, `g`
  garrisons, `q` fortress quests and `run.sh`, `da2` dragon arenas.

  `engine.sh` the minimap traffic and location probe; `f2` the hold machine
  and the quest labels; `f4` the Map tab poll budget and party HUD slots; the
  zoom geometry is checked in `r27_minimap`, the spawner's zone slices in
  `r28_s1`.
- **Round 33** (`r33_<lane>`): `ds` the value rule against the doc
  (`build_doc.py`), `c1` drops, bosses, bags, requirement and
  `drop_income.py`, `c2` professions and progress, `c3` achievements, cloaks
  and the cloak model, `c4` enchant tiers, upgrades, crown and families, `c5`
  crit, vendors, repair, potions and the capital services.
- **Round 34** (`r34_<lane>`): `s1a` events, specs, call sites and the

  ambience and music rules, the approval list and `engine.sh`, the pass cost
  and flowing-water census; `f1` the wading rule and `engine.sh`, a mob at
  real water crossings; `f2` the Bag of Coins, the sell refusal, the damage
  fit, the cooking order and `render_icons.py`; `f3` rivers never cover a
  POI core; `wisp` the Wisp's blink never lands in a liquid.
- **Round 35** (`r35_<lane>`): `t` the rotated boxes, `engine.sh` the
  turning-mob sweep and ray cost, `upstream_check.sh` the engine bug (FIXED or
  BUG PRESENT); `f` the break hook, broken look, empty hand, dig sounds,
  flint and quest lists, its approval list `approved.txt` and `engine.sh`;
  `m` the capital scheduler and either/or rule, `engine.sh` the location and
  ambience passes; `c` the creation draft and window geometry, `engine.sh` a
  creation through the real receive-fields chain; `e` the dawn rule,
  `engine.sh` rats across a dawn; `b` the level-proof talents and the picks,
  `numbers.py` the conversion, review and decided tables.
- **Round 36** (`r36_<lane>`): `f` the target predicate, evade rule, banner
  and timing line, `engine.sh` a reset inside and outside the wander radius;
  `f2` the held button across a hotbar switch, `engine.sh` a held dig across

  before/after pages, `author.lua` row proposals; `w2` every bench faces out,
  `engine.sh` the measured seat halves; `w3` ground cover in the band round
  starts and capitals, `engine.sh` the band on a fresh world; `p` the POI
  renders and review page (`dump.lua`, `render.py`, `page.py`); `a`
  `paint_art.py`, the reproducible textures. Lane RD (roads) added no folder.
